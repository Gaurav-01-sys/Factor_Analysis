This repository centers on the `Factor_analysis_task_08_04_25.ipynb` notebook—accompanied by a `data/` folder housing your raw datasets—and guides you step by step through a complete factor‐analysis workflow: first defining clear objectives, then loading your CSV data, handling missing values and standardizing variables; next conducting exploratory data analysis with summary statistics and visualizations of distributions and correlations; followed by extraction of latent factors using FA and common‐factor methods, choosing the number of factors via eigenvalues and a scree plot; then applying both orthogonal (Varimax) and oblique (Promax) rotations and interpreting the resulting factor‐loading patterns; after that computing individual factor scores and demonstrating how to incorporate them into downstream tasks such as regression or clustering; and finally summarizing your insights, discussing limitations, and suggesting avenues for further investigation. 
Also included is 'Diversity Analysis', which focuses on ranking based of Pharmacies based on the diversification of their products.


The repository also includes a small 21-page document theoretical reference titled **'Factor Analysis.pdf'** which I had used for reference. The data used is synthetic and just for experimentation purpose.
